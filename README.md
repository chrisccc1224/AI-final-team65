## Overview
This project is a movie rating prediction model. We used metadata related to the movie instead of review feeding in random forest to predict the score on IMDb, which is a famous movie rating platform. According to the result we used MSE and R^2 score to evaluate.
We also conducted experiments to test the model's performance under different parameters, and visualized the results with charts for easier analysis.
